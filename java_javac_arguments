# Arguments applicable to both `java` and `javac`  | -*- coding: us-ascii; mode: conf-javaprop; -*- [ACE]
#
# This is both a `javac` and `java` command-line argument file.  The two are largely syntax compatible:
# `https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/javac.html#command-line-argument-files` and
# `https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/java.html#java-command-line-argument-files`.
#
# This file is a referent both of `javac` commands issued at runtime by software builders, and of `java`
# commands written into the source-launch files under `./bin/`.  Not all arguments are allowed here;
# see `https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/java.html#using-source-file-mode-to-launch-single-file-source-code-programs`.

   --class-path /tmp/Makeshift/ # Cf. `-d` in `./javac_arguments`.
 # --enable-preview
      # Any actual use of a preview feature results in a warning visible to the user
      # which (in most cases) cannot be suppressed.  https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12
   --source 22 # To allow for any `--enable-preview` above.
      # Otherwise only `./java_arguments` would need this argument, q.v. for the reason.

# NOTE
# ----
#   ACE  ASCII character encoding: this being (also) a `java` command-line argument file, it is required.
