   --source-path :
      # Empty for the sake of consistent, predictable control over the compilation process.  This defeats
      # implicit compilation of ‘additional source files’, ensuring that source files given by Makeshift
      # alone are compiled.  One problem it avoids: `javac` by default implicitly compiles a source file
      # when its class file is missing, but not when the class file predates the source file.
