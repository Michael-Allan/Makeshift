# This file is a referent of `javac` commands issued at runtime by software builders.  For syntax:
# `https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/specs/man/javac.html#command-line-argument-files`.

   -d /tmp/building/ # The output directory for class files.
      # Cf. `--class-path` in `./java_javac_arguments`.
   --source-path . # The working directory `.` is the command directory, as per
      # `./build_instructions.brec`.  Even when no ‘additional source files’ need
      # compilation it serves to stop the source path defaulting to the class path.
