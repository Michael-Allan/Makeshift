# Arguments for the `javac` compiler  | -*- coding: us-ascii; mode: conf-javaprop; -*- [ACE]
#
# This is both a `javac` and `java` command-line argument file.  The two are largely syntax compatible:
# `https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/specs/man/javac.html#command-line-argument-files` and
# `https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/specs/man/java.html#java-command-line-argument-files`.
#
# This file is a referent both of `javac` commands issued at runtime by software builders, and of `java`
# commands written into the source-launch files under `./bin/`.  Not all arguments are allowed, as per
# `https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/specs/man/java.html#using-source-file-mode-to-launch-single-file-source-code-programs`.

   --class-path /tmp/building/ # The same as `-d` in `javac_arguments_addendum`.
 # --enable-preview # To allow for the use of text blocks.  https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/378
 ## no longer required for that purpose as of JDK 15
   --source 15 # Here allowing for any `--enable-preview` above.
      # Otherwise this argument would need only be present in `java_arguments`.

# NOTE
# ----
#   ACE  ASCII character encoding: this being (also) a `java` command-line argument file, it is required.
