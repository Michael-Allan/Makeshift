                >+ PATH=$PATH:*COMMAND-DIRECTORY*/building/Javanese/bin
            + Test it.
                >+ which build
                    / ⇒  *COMMAND-DIRECTORY*/building/Javanese/bin/build
                >+ build
                    / ⇒  Usage: build <PROJECT-PROPER-PATH> <target>...
            + Make it permanent by adding the same to your login initializer:

                  PATH=$PATH:*COMMAND-DIRECTORY*/building/Javanese/bin

        5+ Test the logger.
            >+ logging-test
