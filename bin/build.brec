`build` - Compile the software of a project and prepare it for use

        build <project> <target>…

    - The working directory must be the command directory.
        : see `^^working directory$` @ `^^shell commands$`
          @ http://reluk.ca/project/Java/action_plan.brec
    - The `project` argument gives the proper path of the project to build.
        / The proper path is the relative file path that identifies the project universally.
          E.g. for the present project, use `building/Makeshift` or `building/Makeshift/`.
            : see `^^proper path$` @ http://reluk.ca/project/lexicon.brec
    - Each `target` specifies a build target proper to the project.
        / All build targets should be documented in a source file of the project,
          conventionally named either `BuildTarget.java` or `builder/Target.java`.
            : see ../template/BuildTarget.java
        - Letter case is insignificant here.
        - Characters ‘-’ and ‘_’ are taken as equivalent.
        - Abbreviation is allowed: the given `target` may be any substring of the target name
          that appears in no other target name.

     Scripting a build ─ How a project defines its builder
    ───────────────────
        - For the common case of a Java project with a single package,
          typically all you need is `BuildTarget.java`.
            : see ../example/mixed_top/
        >+ cd <command-directory>
        >+ cp building/Makeshift/template/BuildTarget.java <project>/
        + Edit your `BuildTarget.java`.
            + Correct the package name.
            + Delete the name of any target inapplicable to your project.
        if( you need to customize the builds further )
            / E.g. you have subpackages, or a build target unsupported by the default builder.
            + Code your own `Builder.java`.
                : see `a project may define its own builder` @ Builder.java
                : see ../example/
                - Typically you would subclass the default builder, overriding a method or two.
                    : re `default builder` see ../BuilderDefault.java

     Examples
    ──────────
        - A simple build, requiring no other project to be installed,
          is the `builder` target of the present project.

              build building/Makeshift builder

        - A more typical form of build is:

              build Breccia/Web/imager Java_class_files

        - Convenient equivalents of the above command are:

              build Breccia/Web/imager java_class_files
             
              build Breccia/Web/imager java-class-files
             
              build Breccia/Web/imager cl

            : see `^^- Letter case is insignificant`
            : see `^^- Characters ‘-’ and ‘_’ are taken as equivalent`
            : see `^^- Abbreviation is allowed`
