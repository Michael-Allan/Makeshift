Building a project’s software


    initial set-up, per project
        + Ensure the project is installed according to its instructions.
        + Test the installation by building the minimal target, the software builder itself.
            >+ cd *COMMAND-DIRECTORY*
                / The command directory is where shell commands of the building project are issued,
                  whence all related project installations are accessible by their proper paths.
            >+ build *PROJECT-PROPER-PATH* builder
                / The proper path of a project is the relative file path that identifies it universally.
                  E.g. for the present project, substitute `building` or `building/`.
    routine builds
        - Always the working directory must be the command directory.
            : see `^^working directory for software builds$`
              @ http://reluk.ca/project/building/action_plan.brec
        >+ clean
            / If wanted.
        >+ build *PROJECT-PROPER-PATH* *target*…
            / Characters ‘-’ and ‘_’ are equivalent in target names.
            - The allowable targets should be documented in a source file of the project,
              typically either `Target.java` or `BuildTarget.java`.

     Coding a software builder
    ───────────────────────────
        - For the typical case of a Java project using a default builder,
          all you need is `BuildTarget.java`.
            : re `default builder` see BuilderDefault.java
            : see example/mixed_top/
        >+ cd *COMMAND-DIRECTORY*
        >+ cp building/template/BuildTarget.java *PROJECT-PROPER-PATH*/
        + Edit your `BuildTarget.java`.
            + Correct the package name.
            + Delete the name of any target inapplicable to your project.
        if( you must customize the builder further )
            / E.g. you have a build target unsupported by the default builder.
            + Code your own `Builder.java`.
                : see `a project may define its own builder` @ Builder.java
                : see example/
