# This file is a referent of `javac` commands issued at runtime by software builders.  For syntax:
# `https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/specs/man/javac.html#command-line-argument-files`.

   -d /tmp/building/ # The output directory for class files, same as `--class-path` in `javac_arguments`.
   --source-path . # This (working directory) is `*PROJECTS*/`, as per `./build_instructions.brec`.
      # With no ‘additional source files’ to compile at present, this serves only to stop the source
      # path defaulting to the class path.
